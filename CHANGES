Changelog for vagrant-yaybu
===========================

0.0.7 (2012-09-22)
------------------

 - Don't choke when not using vboxnet0


0.0.6 (2012-02-12)
------------------

 - Add an automatically generated ``vagrant`` node accessible from yay. This
   can provide details about all your defined VMs:: 

       vagrant:
         vms:
           web:
             name: web
             interfaces:
               - name: eth1
                 address: 10.33.33.33
                 netmask: 255.255.255.0
                 gateway: 10.33.33.1

               - name: eth0
                 type: dhcp

   To reference eth1 on the current VM you can use::

       ${vagrant.vm.interfaces[0].address}

   Unfortunately you won't be able to access the IP address of eth0 presently.
   When using vagrant you rarely access the IP directly and have port forwards
   to localhost on the host. eth0 will always be the last interface in the list.

 - The bootstrap functionality will bootstrap the same version of yay and Yaybu
   This can be overriden by setting ``yay_version`` and ``yaybu_version`` in
   your Vagrantfile.


0.0.5 (2012-02-18)
------------------

 - Update to support vagrant 0.9.7+


0.0.4 (2012-02-18)
-------------

 - Update to support vagrant 0.9+
